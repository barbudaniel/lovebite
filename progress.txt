## Codebase Patterns

<!-- 
  This section contains general, reusable patterns discovered during implementation.
  Add patterns that future iterations should follow.
  Keep this section concise - only add truly reusable patterns.
-->

- Next.js 15.x with App Router, pages in `app/(marketing)/`
- Tailwind CSS for styling, config in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Section components in `components/sections/`
- UI primitives in `components/ui/`
- Framer Motion for animations via `components/motion/`
- Test command: `npm run build && npm run lint`
- Use emerald green (#10B981 → #059669) for primary CTAs
- Use coral pink (#F03C4E) for brand accent only
- Creator pages use "Start Free Trial" CTA
- Agency pages use "Book a Demo" CTA
- Grayscale-to-color hover: use `grayscale opacity-50 group-hover:grayscale-0 group-hover:opacity-100` with parent `group` class

### 2026-01-17 - US-001: Update Hero Section Headlines

- What was implemented:
  - Updated hero subheadline to "Upload once, publish everywhere, track what works."
  - Verified headline already matches approved copy: "Your media. Every platform. Easy for everyone."
  - Committed pre-existing CTA changes (Start Free Trial, /join link) that were already in working directory

- Files changed:
  - `components/sections/hero.tsx`

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hero section uses split-line headline with color emphasis via `text-brand-500` class
  - Subheadline is responsive: previously had separate mobile/desktop spans, now simplified to single text
  - Build passes with `npm run build` despite some pre-existing TS errors (Next.js configured to skip type validation)
  - Pre-existing TS errors exist in: privacy/page.tsx, terms/page.tsx, ai/page.tsx, CreatorHero.tsx, StudioHero.tsx, checkbox.tsx

  - Added secondary "Book a Demo" CTA button with outline variant for agencies
  - Both CTAs placed side-by-side with responsive flex layout (stacks on mobile)

- Files changed:
  - `components/sections/hero.tsx`

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `from-emerald-500 to-emerald-600` for primary action buttons (maps to #10B981 → #059669)
  - Add shadow with matching color: `shadow-emerald-500/25` for emerald buttons
  - Secondary CTAs use `variant="outline"` with slate border/text colors

  - Fully responsive design (smaller icons and gap on mobile)

- Files changed:
  - `components/sections/hero.tsx`

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `grayscale opacity-50 group-hover:grayscale-0 group-hover:opacity-100` pattern for grayscale-to-color transitions
  - Wrap icon in `group` class div to enable group-hover effects
  - Platform brand colors: OnlyFans #00AFF0, Fansly #1FA3F3, LoyalFans #FF5722, Instagram #E4405F
