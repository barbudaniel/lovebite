- Tailwind CSS for styling, config in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Section components in `components/sections/`

- Test command: `npm run build && npm run lint`
- Use emerald green (#10B981 → #059669) for primary CTAs
- Use coral pink (#F03C4E) for brand accent only
- Creator pages use "Start Free Trial" CTA

### 2026-01-17 - US-001: Update Hero Section Headlines

- What was implemented:
  - Updated hero subheadline to "Upload once, publish everywhere, track what works."

- Files changed:
  - `components/sections/hero.tsx`

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hero section uses split-line headline with color emphasis via `text-brand-500` class
  - Subheadline is responsive: previously had separate mobile/desktop spans, now simplified to single text
  - Build passes with `npm run build` despite some pre-existing TS errors (Next.js configured to skip type validation)
  - Pre-existing TS errors exist in: privacy/page.tsx, terms/page.tsx, ai/page.tsx, CreatorHero.tsx, StudioHero.tsx, checkbox.tsx

- Files changed:
  - `components/sections/hero.tsx`
