## /STUDIO PAGE - SEO TRUST REVIEW

### Status: ✅ All Items Resolved (DEC-014)

### Flagged Copy Edits (Awaiting Approval)

#### Edit 1: Trust Badge - "Enterprise-ready" ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Current:**
> Enterprise-ready

**Recommended:**
> Built for teams

**Rationale:** "Enterprise-ready" implies security certifications, SLAs, or compliance standards that may not exist. "Built for teams" is accurate and less risky.

---

#### Edit 2: FAQ Q1 - "No hard limit" ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Current:**
> There's no hard limit. Lovdash is built for studios managing anywhere from 2 to 200+ creators.

**Recommended:**
> Lovdash is built for studios managing anywhere from 2 to 200+ creators. Your plan determines how many active creator accounts you can add.

**Rationale:** "No hard limit" is misleading—every system has limits. Lead with the capability, then clarify plan-based limits.

---

#### Edit 3: FAQ Q4 - Data export claim ⚠️ LOW
**Current:**
> Cancel anytime—your data exports with you.

**Recommended:**
> No long-term contracts. Pay monthly or annually (with a discount). Cancel anytime.

**Rationale:** Data export feature needs verification. If it exists, keep it. If not, remove the claim.

---

#### Edit 4: CTA Trust Line - Response time ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Current:**
> We'll reach out within 1 business day.

**Recommended:**
> We typically respond within 1-2 business days.

**Rationale:** Hard timing promises are difficult to consistently meet. "Typically" provides flexibility.

---

#### Edit 5: FAQ Q3 - White-label availability ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Current:**
> Custom branding options are available on enterprise plans.

**Recommended (if feature exists):**
> Custom branding options are available on enterprise plans. Contact sales for details.

**Recommended (if feature not built):**
> Custom branding options are planned for enterprise plans. Contact sales to discuss.

**Rationale:** Claiming a feature is "available" when it's not built is misleading.

---

#### Edit 6: Final CTA Subheadline ⚠️ HIGH
**Current:**
> Join studios already managing their roster with Lovdash.

**Recommended (if no studio customers yet):**
> Join studios and agencies scaling their operations with Lovdash.

**OR:**
> Be among the first studios to manage your roster with Lovdash.

**Rationale:** Implying existing customers when there are none is a trust violation. If you have studio customers, keep original.

---

#### Edit 7: FAQ Q5 - Migration claim ⚠️ LOW
**Current:**
> Existing media can be migrated—talk to our team for details.

**Recommended:**
> Migration assistance is available—talk to our team for details.

**Rationale:** "Can be migrated" implies automated feature. "Assistance" is more accurate if it's manual help.

---

#### Edit 8: Social Proof Section ⚠️ HIGH
**Current:**
> **X+ creators managed** through Lovdash
> **Y+ media files** organized and tagged

**Recommendation:**
- Use ONLY real, verifiable numbers
- If numbers are small (e.g., 14 creators), use different framing: "Early studios already onboarding"
- If no stats, SKIP this section entirely—do not show placeholder text

**Example with real numbers:**
> **14 creators** currently managed
> **2,000+ media files** organized

---

### SEO Improvements (No Compliance Risk)

#### Meta Description Enhancement
**Current:**
> Manage every creator from one dashboard. Lovdash for Studios gives agencies the tools to organize, schedule, and track content across your entire roster.

**Recommended (more action-oriented):**
> Manage every creator from one dashboard. Organize, schedule, and track content across your entire roster with role-based access and cross-creator analytics.

**Rationale:** Adds specific feature keywords, more scannable.
